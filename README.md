## Problem Statement
How Big Mountain resort could alter its pricing strategy to lower the operation cost based on the ‘best value to their customers’ by comparing their facilities with other resorts in their market segment using data-driven strategies to recoup the increased operational cost of $1.54MM for installing new chair list this season, while keeping the profit margins at 9.2% and give an insight on annual revenue for the season over the next year.
